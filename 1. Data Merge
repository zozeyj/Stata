//Set current directory 
cd "/Users/yejikim/Documents/stata-scripts"

use "USelection.dta"

br //The dataset has 4 observations for each state, need to drop 3 out of four
rename YEARYEAR YEAR 
drop if YEAR==2008 //let's observe 2020 data only 
drop if party=="Republican" //each state has number of votes for Republican and Democratic candidate, only leave votes for Democratic candidate 

//check our work
count //51
tab abb // one observation per state 

//create variable that shows what % of the voters supported candidate Biden in 2020 
generate percdem = (numvotes / tvts20082020)*100  
sum percdem, detail //no number seems rediculously large or small

//confirm the data with common knowledge of US political standing
rename name state 
list state if percdem < 30 // West Virginia and Wyoming - Rep states
list state if percdem > 65 // D.C., Maryland, Mass, and Vermont - Dem states

//now leave variables of interest only and save
keep abb percdem legislators marijuanalegal land
save Merge1.dta

//Bring in second dataset 
use "USgovprog.dta"
describe // both dataset has 'state' 'abb' 
// let's look more into 'year', is it also 2020? 
summarize year // it is 2015 data, we see there are 51 obs  
tab abb // check one observation per each state 

//merge 
merge 1:1 abb using Merge1.dta // success!
br // check in each state "percdem legislators marijuanalegal land" were added in toe end 
save "Merge3.dta"

**analysis 1. Marijuana Legalization Prediction*******

tab marijuanalegal, nolabel // 1==illegal, 2==limited, 3==medical, 4==legalized

sum urban // 1- 100 scale scores 
tabstat urban, by(marijuanalegal) // legalized states have on average 80% of urbanization compared to 68% in illegal  
tabstat minwage, by(marijuanalegal) //$8.5 average for legalized marijuana vs $7 illegal 
tabstat uninsu, by(marijuanalegal) // 10% uninsured in mari illegal states and 7.9% in mari legal states 

gen marifullegal = marijuanalegal == 4 //create an indicator variable 
tab marifullegal

corr marifullegal urban minwage uninsu // minwage has the strongest correlation (0.60) with marifullegal, followed by negative correlation (-0.48) with minimum wage and uninsured ppulation 
 
//no perfect colliniearity observed 
 
regress marifullegal urban minwage uninsu //F-stat (12.12, P-val<0.0001, minwage has coeff 0.282 (p-val<0.001)) -- that is $1 increase in state minimum wage increases the change of the state turning into full legalization of marijuana by 28%

//however, need to verify the marilegal stage of the 2015 as marifullegal is 2020 data. Given 2008 and 2020 marilegal barely has changes, it is assumed here that it is static.
